	<p>Meeting a new group of people and have no idea what they like? This application is supposed to keep track of your interests/hobbies (like with your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> profile) and help you find people who have similar intersts as you.</p>
	<p>Log in and put in your interests on your <a href="profile">Profile page</a>. Once you've done that, go to the <a href="group">Create Group page</a> to see if anyone in a new group of people you meet have any similar interests (assuming they have an account or have facebook).</p>
